# usage

After installing dependencies you can run in this:

* `npm start` : it runs the app in a live electron process
* `npm package` : it creates an **electron-war 1.0.0.exe** app in **electron-war-package\distribution**

For both, you can read the backend log into the electron window using **F1 keyword**.
